\subsection{Discovery}

Nodes get new peers relevant to them by advertising their \texttt{Saturation Depth}.

A node advertises its \texttt{Saturation Depth} to its peers upon initial connection, aswell as every time the \texttt{Saturation Depth} changes.

This constitutes a \emph{subscription}, in which the peer should always share connection information for peers that are in the \texttt{Proximity Bin} corresponding to the \texttt{Saturation Depth} of the node \emph{or closer}.

The Subscription message, in which the \texttt{Saturation Depth} is advertised, has the following format:

\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
DEPTH = LIST(UINT8)
\end{lstlisting}

The message containing the connection information for peers has the following format:

\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
PEERS = LIST(LIST(*BZZADDRESS))
\end{lstlisting}
